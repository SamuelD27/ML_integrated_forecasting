GitHub Push Instructions
========================

Your code has been committed locally. To push to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. First, create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it: stock_analysis (or your preferred name)
   - Make it Private or Public as you prefer
   - DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

   # If your repository URL is https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stock_analysis.git
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stock_analysis.git

   # Or if using SSH:
   git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/stock_analysis.git

3. Push your code:
   git push -u origin main

   # If your default branch is 'master' instead of 'main':
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main

4. If you get authentication errors with HTTPS:
   - You may need to use a Personal Access Token instead of password
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens
   - Generate a new token with 'repo' scope
   - Use this token as your password when prompted

5. Alternative: Use GitHub CLI (if installed):
   gh repo create stock_analysis --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
