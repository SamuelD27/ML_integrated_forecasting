# Quantitative Stock & Portfolio Analysis: Models, Concepts & Project Design

## Introduction

This report outlines the design of a modular codebase for personal stock and portfolio analysis.  The goal is to empower non‑professional investors to conduct quantitative research, forecast asset prices, evaluate risk and construct portfolios informed by financial theory.  The repository is organised with clear separation between single‑stock analysis and multi‑asset (portfolio) workflows and uses Python as the primary language with optional R integration.

## Key Models and Concepts

### Time‑Series Forecasting

* **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)** – ARIMA models combine autoregression (past values influencing future values), differencing (to make non‑stationary data stationary) and moving average terms.  They are well‑suited to short‑term forecasting of stationary time series【870225147895400†L310-L319】.  The model is specified by three orders: `p` (autoregressive lag), `d` (degree of differencing) and `q` (moving average lag)【870225147895400†L324-L346】.  ARIMA models depend only on historical data and are effective for near‑term forecasts but may struggle to predict turning points and can be sensitive to parameter choices【870225147895400†L382-L427】.

* **Exponential Smoothing & Holt‑Winters** – Exponential smoothing gives exponentially decreasing weights to past observations, making it adaptive to recent changes.  Single exponential smoothing is suitable for data with no trend or seasonality; double (Holt’s method) adds a trend component; and triple (Holt‑Winters) incorporates seasonality【160335347341955†L136-L165】【160335347341955†L166-L181】.  Holt‑Winters models the level, trend and seasonal components of a series simultaneously【942277219966946†L129-L166】.  These methods are computationally simple and perform well for short‑ to medium‑term forecasting, though they may not handle complex patterns or long‑range forecasting【160335347341955†L210-L288】.

* **Prediction Intervals** – Forecasts should be accompanied by prediction intervals that quantify uncertainty.  A 95 % prediction interval means that in the long run 95 out of 100 intervals will contain the true value; higher confidence levels widen the interval【468863634266894†L141-L148】.

### Risk Metrics

* **Value at Risk (VaR)** – VaR estimates the maximum expected loss over a specified horizon with a given confidence level.  It can be computed using the historical method (reordering past returns), the variance–covariance method (assuming normally distributed returns and using mean and standard deviation) or Monte Carlo simulation【983904180201883†L266-L315】.  VaR answers questions like “What is the worst expected loss with 95 % confidence?”

* **Monte Carlo Simulation & Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** – Monte Carlo methods generate many possible future price paths to create a distribution of outcomes.  GBM models stock prices as following a random walk with drift and volatility; price returns are normally distributed while price levels are log‑normally distributed【569262248736669†L287-L385】.

* **Sharpe Ratio** – Measures risk‑adjusted return by dividing the excess return (over a risk‑free rate) by the standard deviation of returns【719733448842304†L209-L230】.  A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk‑adjusted performance.  It does not account for leverage or differentiate between upside and downside volatility【719733448842304†L245-L315】.

* **CAPM Beta** – Relates an asset’s expected return to its systematic risk relative to the market.  Beta is the covariance of the asset’s returns with the market divided by the variance of market returns【985233146337732†L160-L207】.  A beta above 1 implies greater volatility than the market, while a beta below 1 implies less.

### Portfolio Theory

* **Modern Portfolio Theory & Efficient Frontier** – Portfolio optimisation seeks to combine assets to maximise expected return for a given level of risk or minimise risk for a required return.  The set of optimal portfolios forms the efficient frontier【836681858147528†L266-L297】.  Diversification allows investors to achieve higher returns without proportionally increasing risk【836681858147528†L306-L323】.  Assumptions such as normally distributed returns and rational investors may not always hold, but the framework provides valuable guidance【836681858147528†L334-L370】.

* **Mean‑Variance Optimisation** – A quantitative technique that selects portfolio weights to maximise return for a given variance (risk) or to minimise variance for a target return.  It is the backbone of the efficient frontier and forms the basis for risk‑adjusted portfolio construction.

## Proposed Project Structure

### Explanation of Major Components

1. **Data Retrieval (`data_fetching.py`)** – Uses the `yfinance` library to download daily, weekly or monthly OHLCV data for one or many tickers.  The function returns a DataFrame with multi‑index columns for multiple tickers and includes a helper to compute log returns.  It could be extended to query alternative data sources or to fall back if Yahoo Finance is unavailable.

2. **Utilities (`utils/`)** – Contains helper functions for forward‑filling missing data, resampling to business days and generating standard plots.  Centralising these functions promotes reuse and consistent handling of data across modules.

3. **Single‑Stock Analysis (`single_stock/`)**
   * `forecasting.py` – Provides a `fit_arima` function that fits an ARIMA model to a series and produces point forecasts with confidence intervals.  It also includes `fit_exponential_smoothing` implementing Holt‑Winters models with options for additive or multiplicative trend and seasonality.  These methods are useful for short‑ to medium‑term price forecasting.
   * `risk_metrics.py` – Implements VaR using the historical method, parametric (normal) method and Monte Carlo (GBM) simulation【983904180201883†L266-L315】.  It computes the Sharpe ratio from return data【719733448842304†L209-L230】 and calculates CAPM beta relative to a benchmark【985233146337732†L160-L207】.

4. **Portfolio Analysis (`portfolio/`)**
   * `optimization.py` – Uses convex optimisation (`cvxpy`) to perform mean‑variance optimisation.  It can either minimise variance for a target return or maximise a simplified risk‑adjusted objective (proxy for maximising the Sharpe ratio).  The `efficient_frontier` function produces a set of portfolios across a range of expected returns.
   * `risk_analysis.py` – Aggregates individual asset returns using a weight vector and computes portfolio‑level VaR, Sharpe ratio and beta by reusing the single‑stock metrics.  It includes a function to simulate future portfolio values under a correlated GBM model for risk assessment.

5. **R Integration (`r_scripts/`)** – Provides an example R script using the `forecast` package to perform exponential smoothing.  Users comfortable with R can add more sophisticated models here and call them from Python via `rpy2`.

## Next Steps and Learning Path

1. **Set up Environment** – Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  Consider creating a virtual environment.  If using R integration, ensure R and the `forecast` package are installed.

2. **Explore Data** – Use `data_fetching.download_data` to retrieve historical prices for stocks of interest.  Examine the data with the plotting utilities to understand trends and volatility.

3. **Implement Forecasts** – Start with ARIMA and exponential smoothing on a single stock.  Evaluate forecast accuracy by comparing predicted values to out‑of‑sample data and inspect confidence intervals.

4. **Assess Risk** – Compute VaR using different methods and compare results.  Calculate the Sharpe ratio and CAPM beta to understand risk‑adjusted performance and market sensitivity.

5. **Construct Portfolios** – Select multiple stocks, compute expected returns and covariance matrix, and use `portfolio/optimization.py` to derive optimal weights along the efficient frontier.  Evaluate the resulting portfolios using Sharpe ratio and VaR, and visualise the risk–return trade‑off.

6. **Expand Models** – Once comfortable with traditional models, experiment with more advanced techniques such as vector autoregression (VAR), machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, LSTM networks), or the Black–Litterman model.  Use the modular structure to integrate new methods without disrupting existing functionality.

7. **Continuous Learning** – Read current literature on algorithmic trading and risk management to refine models.  Understand the limitations of each technique; for instance, ARIMA may not predict turning points well【870225147895400†L382-L427】, exponential smoothing assumes patterns persist【160335347341955†L210-L288】, and mean‑variance optimisation relies heavily on estimates of future returns【836681858147528†L334-L370】.

## Conclusion

This project provides a foundation for personal quantitative analysis of stocks and portfolios.  By combining sound financial theory with practical code, it enables users to fetch data, generate forecasts, quantify risk and optimise portfolios.  The modular design encourages incremental learning and future enhancements, such as incorporating alternative data sources, machine learning models or advanced statistical techniques.
